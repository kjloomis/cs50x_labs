# CS50x Lecture Section Lab Repository
This collection of code is created to complement CS50x Miami section series.
This course is an adaption of adaption of [CS50](https://www.cs50.net),
[Harvard University's](http://www.harvard.edu) introduction to the
intellectual enterprises of computer science, and the art of programming,
for MDC students and the South Florida community. All credit for that
Harvard's CS50 goes to [David Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/) and his
team. It's a great introductory course to programming and provides breadth
and depth without being too overwhelming. Check out
[CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) to
learn more about the online version of CS50.

These hands-on activities correspond with the material presented in the
weekly lectures. It is expected that you attend the lectures and examine
the lecture material before attempting the section lab. Lab activities
may be collaborated on in pairs or small teams and there is no grade
associated with the activities.

While solutions are provided for each activity, but make a
solid attempt before peeking at the solution code.
